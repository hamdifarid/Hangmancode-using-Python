# Hangmancode-using-Python
This is a python program used to simulate the hangman game the code is available so if anyone wants to modify it or make some interesting changes to it they are free to do it 
The default number of lives are 13 but this can be changed using the code. 
I have used a downloaded textfile named 1-1000.txt for the different words source:https://gist.github.com/deekayen/4148741, 
While running the program make sure to keep the .py file and the .txt file in the same folder.
